      <p>
        I've created this website to express how much you mean to me.
        It’s my way of sharing my thoughts and emotions, and I hope it
        brings a smile to your face.

          <h3>Express My Feelings</h3>
          <p>I’ve always wanted a creative way to show you how much I care. Because from the time that you told me that you have preference with this kind of situation and how to win your heart is very admirable, and I want to prove it to you that I'm also capable of making this for the person that I always cherish and love.</p>

          <h3>Build a Future</h3>
          <p>This website represents the beginning of something special. I've noticed that you're also one of the individuals who always want or prioritizes growth, I really respect that and to be honest it's also one of my key qualities to the person that I want to grow old with, because growth matters to me.</p>

          <h3>Our Journey</h3>
          <p>This is just the start, and I can't wait for what’s to come. Not gonna lie, we're going to be a LDR setup most of the times but knowing you you're one of the most patient people that I encountered and I fucking love that and also it's inevitable that we're also going into such tough times in the future but I'm willing to take the risk because it's you ashley.</p>

          My Dearest Ashley, <br><br>
          From the moment our paths crossed, I’ve felt a connection that I can’t explain in mere words but I'll always try no matter what. At first, I was afraid to commit because I don't consider myself to date someone beautiful, attractive and smart back then, because I prioritze my goals and will probably not give my most attention to you if ever we're dating, but now I realized that I fell inlove with you and I gave myself some time to adapt to my working habits and how to deal my own problems efficiently and with strategy, for me to finally give you my whole attention and my efforts, because I see a vision of you trying your most hardest to achieve your goals and your passion, and yeahh I want to be a witness and I want to support you all throughout your hardships. I always see you as very determined and willing to give it your all to something that you want to achieve, You're very talented towards art and as humans we have 2 main parts, the left hemisphere(logic) and the right hemisphere(creativity) and not gonna lie you have both which is really fucking impressive ashley. You're kind towards others and you're intelligent, I admire and attracted to intelligence and also you're whole ideology about life, is something that I won't forget.So in this moment, I choose you—openly, wholeheartedly, and without restraint. I want to be the place you find comfort in, the hand that holds yours when things feel heavy, and the voice that reminds you of who you are when you forget. I don’t just want to love you in the easy moments, but in every quiet struggle and every victory you’ll ever have. If fate allows it, I want to spend my days admiring you, supporting you, and loving you in ways that feel safe, deep, and endlessly true.
